    <string name="aboutdesc"> \nBirla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani is one of the most prestigious institutes in the country. Over years, BITS Pilani has maintained the reputation of imparting the right mix of education and experience that form the basis for achieving success in the world. Apogee, the technical festival of BITS Pilani, is a large scale event that has attracted the connoisseurs of engineering and technology over years. It represents the zenith of science and engineering in a landscape of future visionaries and scientists. Retrofuturism is an exploration of the themes of tension between the new and old, between the alienating and empowering effects of technology. It might be best described as the act or tendency of an artist to progress by moving backwards, focussing on the futurist visions of eras past. Futurism was born out of humanity\'s reaction to a sudden thrust into technological revolution. To the many that witnessed the rapid change, it seemed technological utopia was fast approaching. This unbridled optimism caused the collective imagination to run wild. Retrofuturism is a prescriptive art - it fails to define a specific type of art or artist. Instead what it does is more valuable: it describes possible work, and it is then up to the cultural worker to go out and make it. Although many of these visions seem almost comical now, the spirit in which they were created is part of the reason you are currently looking into a glowing rectangle with unlimited, instant access to the sum of all human knowledge.</string>
